# RXPGuides_Themes

This addon adds additional themes to the [RestedXP addon](https://github.com/RestedXP/RXPGuides).

Custom themes are supported with Look and Feel settings, but that doesn't allow additional textures or sharing.

## Creating your own theme

   - As a [.zip](https://github.com/SabreValkyrn/RXPGuides_Themes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
   - Fork and clone locally
2. Copy [RoseGold](./RoseGold) into `/YourTheme`
3. Add `YourTheme/Theme.lua` below `RoseGold/Theme.lua` in [RXPGuides_Themes.toc](./RXPGuides_Themes.toc)
4. Edit texture files and `Theme.lua` as desired
5. Submit your changes for RestedXP review with one of the following
   - As a `.zip` on a [new Issue](https://github.com/SabreValkyrn/RXPGuides_Themes/issues/new)
   - Open a pull request request from your fork

RestedXP staff will then review your theme submission.
